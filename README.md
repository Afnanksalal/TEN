# TEN – The Entrepreneurial Navigator

**TEN** is a tool for early-stage startup founders who want clarity while building.  
It brings together key insights about your startup's risk, reputation, traction, team, and investor readiness — all in one place, and actually useful.

## Why TEN Exists

Most founders are stuck guessing.  
They bounce between pitch templates, scattered advice, and generic dashboards that don’t know anything about *their* startup.

TEN solves this by helping founders:
- Understand where they’re likely to fail
- Know how they’re being perceived online
- Match with the right types of investors
- Improve their pitch with real, specific feedback
- Track competitors and market shifts early
- Get a realistic view of traction and growth
- Plan hiring with intent, not panic
- Prepare for exits (instead of just hoping for one)
- Handle legal basics without surprises

It’s built to be something founders can *actually use*, not just a folder of static PDFs.
